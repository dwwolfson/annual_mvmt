Log of Analysis:

late April/early May 2023:
- repulled all the data and ran through the workflow again
- fixed a bug in the mcp fitting script that didn't keep track of the number of intercepts in 
  models that were skipped becuase R hat values were over 1.1
- went through and looked at all the models from 2022-2023 in the best mod plots folder to check if the fits were ok and entered them into the mcp_assessment.csv file

TO DO: 
- update list of swans skipped for dispersing, incomplete years, and arkansaw captures?
- and filter them out for the timing of fall and spring stuff (but not total extent?, except for Arkansaw?)



mid June:
- 'hand estimated' migration metrics from Arkansas swans
- added in their breeding lat/long to the ids.csv
- finalized number of collars, deployments, and number filtered for each reason
- adding in figures to the results sections and then moving on to discussion
