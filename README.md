# annual_mvmt

to-do
- comprehensive visualization of the active dates for all collars
- full set of NSD plots (with think line width and high alpha)
- pick out a few representative NSD cases
- redo map of breeding lat vs distance moved south
- redo map of water condition (possibly animate through the season with snapshots?)
- map of temps across range to correspond with swan water condition?
